# code-snippets
A stash of non-related code files I worked on and may use in the future.
It includes either very simple projects that are not worth their own repository, or are literally code fragments I find useful but still need place to be online for me to reuse.
The code varies in quality, so beware of that if you for some reason want to use some of it later on. Have a good day!
